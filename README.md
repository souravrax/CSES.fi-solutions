## Details

The CSES Problem Set is a collection of competitive programming practice problems.

The goal of the project is to create a comprehensive high quality problem set for learning competitive programming. The current collection has 200 problems, and new problems will be gradually added.

## Languages

You can solve problems in several languages, including C++, Java, and Python. More information about available languages is *[here](https://cses.fi/howto/)*.

## Hacking

After solving a problem, you can view the solutions by other users and try to hack them by giving a test case where the solution fails. If your hack is successful, the new test case will be added to the test data and all submissions will be regraded.

## Books

The problem set has been designed so that you can use it together with recent competitive programming books, listed *[here](https://cses.fi/book/index.php)*. The books discuss techniques and ideas that are useful when solving the problems.

## License

The license of the problem set is Creative Commons BY-NC-SA.
